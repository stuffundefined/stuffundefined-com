            <h2>Memoir</h2>
            <p>This is a memoir I wrote in 8th grade about making this website.</p>
            <article>
                I had been taking an online coding course for a few months. I remember that at the beginning of 2020, I wanted to try coding again after taking a break from it for a few years, so I signed up for an online course.
                <br>Fast-forward to August, and knew the basics of making a simple website. I thought it might be fun to make a project I was proud of, and that anybody would be able to see. I decided to make a publicly available website.
                <br>So I found a cheap domain and bought it. Then I started coding the site. We were in Cape Cod and I didn’t have access to my computer, so I borrowed my mom’s computer. I downloaded the software I needed and got to work.
                <br>After a day or two, I had most of the website done. After adding a project and publishing it to the hosting service, I was able to rest.
                <br>I remember when I was very young, I wondered how websites were made and published. And now I’ve done that myself.
                <br><br>PS. You can see my website on… Wait, if you’re seeing this, you’re already here. Nevermind.
