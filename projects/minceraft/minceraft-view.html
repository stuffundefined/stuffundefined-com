       <h3>
           We don't mine. We don't craft. We don't play Minecraft.<br/>We mince rafts.
       </h3>
       <h2>How to join</h2>
       <p>DM me on Discord, notMYREALacCOUNT125#1587. Note that you will need to bring a knife. We'll find rafts to mince together.</p>
       <h2>Why</h2>
       <p>BECAUSE THE RAFTS MUST BE MINCED! I'm tired of people saying Minceraft is a play on Minecraft. It's not. It's its own thing. Let's protest against people who think it's a play on Minecraft by MINCING THEIR RAFTS!!</p>
